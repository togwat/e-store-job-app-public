# e-store-job-app-public
A public WIP snapshot of the web app used to manage repair jobs of phones and other electronic devices. 
The latest progress in this snapshot is from February 2023. 
To run it, this app must be hosted on a server using Apache and MariaDB.

This snapshot lacks in CSS visuals, however it demonstrates strong proficiency in php with OOP, and Linux server management.
